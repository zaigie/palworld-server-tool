Features and roadmap based on parsing of `Level.sav` save files:

- [x] Complete player data
- [x] Player Palworld data
- [x] Guild data
- [ ] Player inventory data

Features implemented using official RCON commands (available only for servers):

- [x] Retrieve server information
- [x] Online player list
- [x] Kick/ban players
- [x] In-game broadcasting
- [x] Smooth server shutdown with broadcast message

This tool uses bbolt for single file storage, fetching and saving data from RCON and Level.sav files via scheduled tasks. It provides a simple visual interface and REST API for easy management and development.

Due to limited maintenance and development staff, we welcome front-end, back-end developers, and even data engineers to submit PRs!

## Download

> [!CAUTION]
> The task of parsing `Level.sav` requires **significant system memory (often 4GB-6GB) in a short period (about 1-3min)** , this portion of memory is released after the parsing task is completed. Ensure your server has enough memory!
>
> If the conditions are not met and still needed, the `pst-agent` is deployed on the game server, and the `pst` is deployed on a PC or other server with enough memory to perform the parsing task.

## How to Enable RCON for Private Servers

You need to enable RCON functionality on your server. If your private server tutorial includes this, great. If not, modify the `PalWorldSettings.ini` file.

**This is the file where various in-game multipliers and probabilities are set.** At the end of the file, you'll find:

```txt
AdminPassword=...,...,RCONEnabled=true,RCONPort=25575
```

![RCON](./docs/img/rcon.png)

Please **shut down the server before making modifications**. Set an AdminPassword, and fill in `RCONEnabled` and `RCONPort` as shown above. Then restart the server.

## Installation and Deployment

- [File Deployment](#file-deployment)
  - [Linux](#linux)
    - [pst-agent deployment](./README.agent.en.md#linux)
  - [Windows](#windows)
    - [pst-agent deployment](./README.agent.en.md#windows)
- [Docker Depolyment](#docker-deployment)
  - [Monolithic Deployment](#monolithic-deployment)
  - [Agent Deployment](#agent-deployment)

Rimer believes that by **putting the pst tool and the game server on the same physical machine**, there are some situations where you might not want to deploy them on the same machine:

- Must be deployed separately on another server
- Only need to deploy on a local PC
- The game server performance is weak and not satisfied, using one of the above two schemes

Please refer to [pst-agent deployment tutorial](./README.agent.en.md)

### File Deployment

#### Linux

##### Download and Extract

```bash
# Download pst_{version}_{platform}_{arch}.tar.gz and extract to the pst directory
mkdir -p pst && tar -xzf pst_v0.5.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz -C pst
```

##### Configuration

1. Open the directory and allow execution

   ```bash
   cd pst
   chmod +x pst sav_cli
   ```

2. Find the `config.yaml` file and modify it as per the instructions.

   For `decode_path`, it's usually the pst directory plus `sav_cli`. If unsure about the absolute path, execute `pwd` in the terminal.

   ```yaml
   web: # web configuration
     password: "" # web management mode password
     port: 8080 # web service port
   rcon: # RCON configuration
     address: "127.0.0.1:25575" # RCON address
     password: "" # Set AdminPassword
     timeout: 5 # RCON request timeout, recommended <= 5
     sync_interval: 60 # Interval for syncing online player status with RCON service, in seconds
   save: # Save file parsing configuration
     path: "/path/to/you/Level.sav" # Save file path
     decode_path: "/path/to/your/sav_cli" # Save file parsing tool path, usually in the same directory as pst
     sync_interval: 600 # Interval for syncing data from save file, in seconds, recommended >= 600
   ```

##### Run

```bash
./pst
```

```log
2024/01/31 - 22:39:20 | INFO | palworld-server-tool/main.go:75 | Starting PalWorld Server Tool...
2024/01/31 - 22:39:20 | INFO | palworld-server-tool/main.go:76 | Version: Develop
2024/01/31 - 22:39:20 | INFO | palworld-server-tool/main.go:77 | Listening on http://127.0.0.1:8080 or http://192.168.1.66:8080
2024/01/31 - 22:39:20 | INFO | palworld-server-tool/main.go:78 | Swagger on http://127.0.0.1:8080/swagger/index.html
```

For background operation (running after SSH window is closed):

```bash
# Run in the background and save the log in server.log
nohup ./pst > server.log 2>&1 &
# To view logs
tail -f server.log
```

##### Stopping Background Process

```bash
kill $(ps aux | grep 'pst' | awk '{print $2}') | head -n 1
```

##### Access

Access via browser at http://127.0.0.1:8080 or http://{Local Network IP}:8080

Access at http://{Server IP}:8080 after opening firewall and security group in cloud servers.

> [!WARNING]
> If you open the file for the first time, nothing will be displayed. Please **wait until the first sav archive synchronization is complete**
>
> If your server configuration is sufficient and performance is good, you can try to make `save.sync_interval` shorter, the default is 600s (10min).

#### Windows

##### Download and Extract

Extract `pst_v0.5.0_windows_x86.zip` to any directory (recommend naming the folder `pst`).

##### Configuration

Find the `config.yaml` file in the extracted directory and modify it according to the instructions.

For `decode_path`, it's typically the pst directory plus `sav_cli.exe`.

You can also right-click - "Properties", view the path and file name, and then concatenate them. (Same for archive file path and tool path)

![](./docs/img/windows_path.png)

> [!WARNING]
> Instead of pasting the copied path directly into `config.yaml`, add another '\\' in front of all '\\', as shown below
>
> It is also important to make sure that the `config.yaml` file is **ANSI encoded**, other encoding formats will cause problems such as path errors!!

```yaml
web: # web configuration
  password: "" # web management mode password
  port: 8080 # web service port
rcon: # RCON configuration
  address: "127.0.0.1:25575" # RCON address
  password: "" # Set AdminPassword
  timeout: 5 # RCON request timeout, recommended <= 5
  sync_interval: 60 # Interval for syncing online player status with RCON service, in seconds
save: # Save file parsing configuration
  path: "C:\\path\\to\\you\\Level.sav" # Save file path
  decode_path: "C:\\path\\to\\your\\sav_cli.exe" # Save file parsing tool path, usually in the same directory as pst
  sync_interval: 600 # Interval for syncing data from save file, in seconds, recommended >= 600
```

##### Running

Two ways to run on Windows:

1. start.bat (Recommended)

   Find and double-click the `start.bat` file in the extracted directory.

2. Press `Win + R`, enter `powershell` to open Powershell, navigate to the directory of the downloaded executable file using the `cd` command.

   ```powershell
   .\pst.exe
   ```

```log
2024/01/31 - 22:39:20 | INFO | palworld-server-tool/main.go:75 | Starting PalWorld Server Tool...
2024/01/31 - 22:39:20 | INFO | palworld-server-tool/main.go:76 | Version: Develop
2024/01/31 - 22:39:20 | INFO | palworld-server-tool/main.go:77 | Listening on http://127.0.0.1:8080 or http://192.168.31.214:8080

```

If you see the preceding interface, it indicates that the operation is successful. Keep the window open.

##### Access

Access via browser at http://127.0.0.1:8080 or http://{Local Network IP}:8080

Access at http://{Server IP}:8080 after opening firewall and security group in cloud servers.

> [!WARNING]

>
> If your server configuration is sufficient and performance is good, you can try to make `save.sync_interval` shorter, the default is 600s (10min).

### Docker Deployment

#### Monolithic Deployment

Only one container is needed. Map the game's save directory to the container's internal directory, running on the same physical host as the game server.

```bash
docker run -d --name pst \
-p 8080:8080 \
-v /path/to/your/Pal/Saved/SaveGames/0/E8F71231A51246429C7CCCCD51320C22:/game \
-e WEB__PASSWORD="your password" \
-e RCON__ADDRESS="172.17.0.1:25575" \
-e RCON__PASSWORD="your password" \
-e SAVE__PATH="/game/Level.sav" \
-e SAVE__SYNC_INTERVAL=600 \
jokerwho/palworld-server-tool:latest
```

Most importantly, use `-v` to map the game's save file (Level.sav) directory to the container's `/game` directory.

##### Persistence

If you need to persist the `pst.db` file:

```bash
# Create the file first to prevent it from being recognized as a directory
touch pst.db
```

Then add `-v ./pst.db:/app/pst.db` in `docker run -v`.

##### Environment Variables

Set various environment variables, similar to those in [`config.yaml`](#configuration). The table below lists them:

> [!WARNING]
> Pay attention to the distinction between single and multiple underscores. It's best to copy the variable names from the table below for modifications!

|     Variable Name     |   Default Value   |  Type  |                                      Description                                       |
| :-------------------: | :---------------: | :----: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
|    WEB\_\_PASSWORD    |        ""         |  Text  |                         Password for Web interface admin mode                          |
|      WEB\_\_PORT      |       8080        | Number |    **Changing the container mapping port is recommended instead of modifying this**    |
|                       |                   |        |                                                                                        |
|    RCON\_\_ADDRESS    | "127.0.0.1:25575" |  Text  |            RCON service address, can use container network 172.17.0.1:25575            |
|   RCON\_\_PASSWORD    |        ""         |  Text  |                     AdminPassword in the server configuration file                     |
|    RCON\_\_TIMEOUT    |         5         | Number |                      Timeout for individual RCON service requests                      |
| RCON\_\_SYNC_INTERVAL |        60         | Number |             Interval for requesting RCON server to sync player online data             |
|                       |                   |        |                                                                                        |
|     SAVE\_\_PATH      |        ""         |  Text  |          Game save path **be sure to fill in the path inside the container**           |
|  SAVE\_\_DECODE_PATH  |  "/app/sav_cli"   |  Text  | ⚠️ Built into the container, do not modify, or it will cause save analysis tool errors |
| SAVE\_\_SYNC_INTERVAL |        600        | Number |                         Interval for syncing player save data                          |

#### Agent Deployment

Two containers are required: `palworld-server-tool` and `palworld-server-tool-agent`.

Applicable for:

- Separate deployment on other servers.
- Deployment only on a local personal computer.
- If the game server's performance is weak and does not meet the requirements, use one of the above two schemes.

##### First, run the agent container

```bash
docker run -d --name pst-agent \
-p 8081:8081 \
-v /path/to/your/Pal/Saved/SaveGames/0/E8F71231A51246429C7CCCCD51320C22:/game \
-e SAV_FILE="/game/Level.sav" \
jokerwho/palworld-server-tool-agent:latest
```

You need to `-v` to the directory where the game save file (Level.sav) is located, mapping it to the `/game` directory in the container.

| Variable Name | Default Value | Type |                             Description                             |
| :-----------: | :-----------: | :--: | :-----------------------------------------------------------------: |
|   SAV_FILE    |      ""       | Text | Game save path **be sure to fill in the path inside the container** |

##### Then, run the pst container

```bash
docker run -d --name pst \
-p 8080:8080 \
-e WEB__PASSWORD="your password" \
-e RCON__ADDRESS="Game server IP:25575" \
-e RCON__PASSWORD="your password" \
-e SAVE__PATH="http://Game server IP:Agent port/sync" \
-e SAVE__SYNC_INTERVAL=600 \
jokerwho/palworld-server-tool:latest
```

##### Persistence

If you need to persist the `pst.db` file:

```bash
# Create the file first to prevent it from being recognized as a directory
touch pst.db
```

Then add `-v ./pst.db:/app/pst.db` in `docker run -v`.

##### Environment Variables
